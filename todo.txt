- add a 'fork' button for subroutines that makes a copy with a different id
- add memoize builtin to fibonacci example.  use underscore
- implement builtins for dealing with lists and maps

- add a smart delete feature for subroutines
    - list the number of subroutines that use this one.  Click this to see their names
    - if this subroutine is used by another, ask if we should delete that one as well
    - if there are other subroutines that are only used by this subroutine, ask if we should delete those as well


- instructions on page
    - right-click nodes to delete them, right-click nibs to delete connections
    - warn about clobbering with imports (based on id)

- add more example programs
    - fibonacci
