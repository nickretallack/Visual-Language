- add a place to put documentation on implementations

- add a smart delete feature for subroutines
    - list the number of subroutines that use this one.  Click this to see their names
    - if this subroutine is used by another, ask if we should delete that one as well
    - if there are other subroutines that are only used by this subroutine, ask if we should delete those as well

- use Ace editor for the javascript editors
- edit the number of inputs/outputs on existing subroutines

- think about how version control could work
    - save every version of a function
    - allow users to upgrade theirs and notice when input compatibility is broken.

- online persistence
    - should still allow you to play around in localstorage if you are not registered, but you must register in order to upload your work.
    - allow you to search through all the users and see their things
        - mark things private?  But you can't do that if you used them in public programs.  Notify that all referencing functions must be private too.

- add some higher order functions
    - map, reduce
- remember what program you were looking at in localstorage
- add a 'fork' button for subroutines that makes a copy with a different id
- add memoize builtin to fibonacci example.  use underscore
- implement builtins for dealing with lists and maps


- instructions on page
    - right-click nodes to delete them, right-click nibs to delete connections
    - warn about clobbering with imports (based on id)

- add more example programs
    - fibonacci
    - factorial
    - guess the number
    - how are you?
    - but thou must!
    - how should I respond?

- fix the font somehow
- replace alerts with a console?
- Add box/multi-select
    - convert selection to subroutine, counting inputs and outputs
