- add a place to put documentation on implementations
- don't allow connections from inputs to inputs or outputs to outputs
- add a smart delete feature for subroutines
    - list the number of subroutines that use this one.  Click this to see their names
    - if this subroutine is used by another, ask if we should delete that one as well
    - if there are other subroutines that are only used by this subroutine, ask if we should delete those as well

- add history support
    - just use the id of the object you're editing

- use Ace editor for the javascript editors

- Create dynamic function call node.  Speficy the inputs and outputs on it dynamically
    Perhaps show it with no normal inputs/outputs at first, but have a special '+' input and output on the right.  When you connect things to this,
    they become new inputs/outputs.  Would need a way to delete them too.  Perhaps as an option in a real right-click menu.

- I should re-do the vis in canvas for more readability.  Should I rotate it to look like all the other visual languages out there?

- make a server-side service that will request arbitrary urls for you

- make a jquery selector builtin

- edit the number of inputs/outputs on existing subroutines
    - needs lots of feedback for when you delete a nib that is in use in some program somewhere
    - ugh, I'd rather this system didn't act so inflexible.  Perhaps I should make an 'unknown-nib' show up and bundle all the higher-index connections into there.
        - this could help for unknown implementation nodes too!  Yeah.
        - it could throw the NotConnected exception if you tried to evaluate off of it.

- make a slider to increase the detail level (make everything smaller), and another to zoom in/out and pan like http://worrydream.com/#!/GesturalZoomAndPan

- add an "Idempotent" checkbox to javascript functions.  If a all trees leading into an idempotent function are idempotetnt, its result can safely be memoized to improve performance of algorithms like fibonacci.
    - add a checkbox to turn off this memoizing on a given subroutine if it takes too much memory
    - only memoize at the furthest point that it is safe to.  Don't bother memoizing intermediate values.
        - how to handle multiple inputs/outputs?  Well, we can only really memoize on a per-connection basis I guess.


- think about how version control could work
    - save every version of a function
    - allow users to upgrade theirs and notice when input compatibility is broken.

- online persistence
    - should still allow you to play around in localstorage if you are not registered, but you must register in order to upload your work.
    - allow you to search through all the users and see their things
        - mark things private?  But you can't do that if you used them in public programs.  Notify that all referencing functions must be private too.

- don't let literal values contain non-json values.  Currently they can if you type stuff in.

- perhaps I should have a save-on-run system?

- add some higher order functions
    - map, reduce
- remember what program you were looking at in localstorage
- add a 'fork' button for subroutines that makes a copy with a different id
- add memoize builtin to fibonacci example.  use underscore
- implement builtins for dealing with lists and maps


- instructions on page
    - right-click nodes to delete them, right-click nibs to delete connections
    - warn about clobbering with imports (based on id)

- fix the font somehow
- replace alerts with a console?
- Add box/multi-select
    - convert selection to subroutine, counting inputs and outputs
